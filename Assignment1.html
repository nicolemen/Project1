      Environmental sustainability is a key component in grappling with the issue of climate change.
      It's a globally recognized issue, but one that can be overlooked in our daily lives.
      Responsible consumption and production is just one of seventeen of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.
      The following statistic is from the official website:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/">
      "Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced –
      equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1 trillion –
      ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers,
      or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices."
    </blockquote>

    <p>According to statistics and descriptions provided by the <cite>United States Environmental Protection Agency</cite> the global emmisions by economic sectors are as follows:</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Electricity and Heat Production (i.e. the burning of coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity and heat)</li>
      <li>Industry (i.e. emissions from chemical, metallurgical, and minenral transformation processes)</li>
      <li>Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (o.e. cultivation of crops and livestock, as well as deforestation)</li>
      <li>Transportation (i.e. fossil fuels burned in road, rail, air, and marine transportation)</li>
    </ol>

        So how do we play our parts in reducing our carbon footprint?
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p> At <a href="https://www.bishops.com" target="_blank">The Bishop's School</a>, students are often
      encouraged to clean up after themselves and to not take more food than they consume. Additionally,
      the fresh fruits and vegetables that would have normally been thrown out are instead composted as part
      of our sustainability initiative. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start growing your own garden</li>
      <li>Compost your food scraps</li>
      <li>Invest in <em>reusable</em> materials (i.e. glass and metal) instead of plastic</li>
      <li>Look to <em>renewable</em> energy options (i.e. solar-powered houses)</li>
