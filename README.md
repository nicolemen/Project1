# Project 1
This contains my HTML code for the first assignment, which is centered around environmental sustainability.
The Advanced HTML is a JavaScript submit button (which currently only returns a message) near the action checklist.

Finished HTML assignment is ff936dc.
Finished CSS assignment is 3a0175d.
Finished Bootstrap assignment is a90cdc4. I updated colors(1) and the form(2), changed icons(3) and image(4) styles, and added a carousel(5).
